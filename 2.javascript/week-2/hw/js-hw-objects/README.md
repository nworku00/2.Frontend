# JavaScript Object Homework Exercises

In this homework, you are going to practice the basics of creating **objects**, using JavaScript as a programming language, by completing problems that will challenge your knowledge of core princples. 

## Objectives 
- Create Objects
- Store and manipulate data in the form of key/value pairs

- Copy the path in the dialoge box
- Navigate to a location on **your local computer in VSCode** where you keep your homework 
- Clone this repsository by typing the following command in your terminal

```
clone [`path that you just copied`]
```

For example: 

```bash 
clone https://github.com/DigitalCraftsStudents/js-hw-objects.git
```

- Navigate into the folder titled `js-hw-objects`
- Open the file called `homework.js` and solve the lab problems 
- To run a file javascript file using node, you can run it from your terminal like this:

```bash
$ node loops.js
```

## Problems 

#### 1. Letter Summary

Write a `letter_histogram` program that asks the user for input, and prints a dictionary containing the tally of how many times each letter in the alphabet was used in the word. For example:

``` 
node homework.js 
Please enter a word: banana 

{'a': 3, 'b': 1, 'n': 2} 
```

*In this exercise, are you using dynamic keys or fixed keys?* 

#### 2. Word Summary
Write a `word_histogram` program that asks the user for a sentence as its input, and prints an object containing the tally of how many times each word was used. For example:

``` 
node homework.js 
Please enter a sentence: To be or not to be 

{'to': 2, 'be': 2, 'or': 1, 'not': 1} 
```
*In this exercise, are you using dynamic keys or fixed keys?* 

#### Bonus Challenge: 
Given a histogram tally (one returned from either letter_histogram or word_summary), print the top 3 words or letters.
