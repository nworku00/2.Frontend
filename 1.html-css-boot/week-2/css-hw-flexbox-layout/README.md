# CSS Flexbox Layout Homework

Using CSS to create a website that looks good to as many users as possible can be a challenge. Your webpage may look great on the screen you designed it on, but if you open the page up on a small laptop, suddenly the page content is squeezed, spilling over, or pushed out of place. If you open that same page on a larger monitor, you might see excess empty space.

However, CSS has some powerful solutions for this. In this homework assignment we will be using flexbox to create different layouts.
