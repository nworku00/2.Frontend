# The City of Refuge Gazette

We will use the project to guide us through the HTML & CSS portions of class. I will use branches for various topics and merge them into the main branch once the concept has been demonstrated - the branches will remain at least until we have completed the front-end portion of class.

I recommend keeping up to date with this repo and using it as an example when practicing front-end skills. 

To start, fork this repo to your organization and clone it.
