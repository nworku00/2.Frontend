## Assignment
Redo the **Huynh Restaurant** site (2-3) pages using bootstrap. 
The [original site is here](http://huynhrestauranthouston.com/cgi-bin/p/awtp-home.cgi?d=huynh-restaurant)


Alternatively, you can find a different restaurant site which needs updating, and update 2-3 pages of the site using bootstrap.

**Here are some suggestions before getting started**

- **Think of an idea and wire frame it**. Don't start coding until you have a wire frame of what you're going to do.  A wire frame can be done with a pen and paper. It doesn't have to be fancy.  You just need to nail down an idea before you start coding. 
- **Pick a color scheme** with [coolors](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending) and keep it consistent.
- **Do not use more than 2 font types** 
    - You can do a lot with a font type.  You can make it bold, large, small, italicized, etc.  It is not necessary to have 20 different fonts types.  2 different font types should be sufficient. 


Here is some inspiration for your restaurant website.  You can try to recreate some of their styles.
