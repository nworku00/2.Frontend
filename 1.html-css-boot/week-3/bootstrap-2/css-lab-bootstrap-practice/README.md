## Setting up Bootstrap

## Bootstrap Stylesheet 
Observe the results of attaching a bootstrap stylesheet to an existing html page

- Open the file `2.LinkCSS.html`
- This file has no styling applied to it, but the html elements have many classes applied to the css attribute.  These are bootstrap class names. 
- Instead of creating your own css stylesheet, link to the Bootstrap stylesheet in the head section of the html page.
- What happened when you applied the stylesheet?
- Add the bootstrap javascript file before the closing body tag.

## Containers

- Open the file in your browser.  There are two purple div tags that span the entire page 
- Link the Bootstrap css stylesheet to this page 
- Apply the `container` class to the first div and observe the changes 
- Apply the `container-fluid` class to the second div and observe the changes


## Rows 
Nest rows inside of a container and obeserve the changes. 

- Open the file `4.Rows.html` 
- Apply the bootstrap stylesheet
- You should see a purple box which is a container.
- Some color has been added to the container and rows that are on the web page to differentiate between the container and row elements.
- Inside the container, add two <div>s and make both elements rows.
- Add some content, like text, inside the <div>s to give the <div>s some height!
